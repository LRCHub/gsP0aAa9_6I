Every time I see you
You're singin' the same old blues
You've got it wrong, love's not a matter of pride
It's a matter of pick and choose
If the sun was shinin'
You'd probably wish for rain
With you, up is down, in is out,
I'm tired of hearing you complain
Heaven's where you find it
Don't you know it's true
Heaven's where you find it
Standin' right there, right in front of you
We got somethin' goin'
Sweeter than a buckwheat cake
Can't you see love's in your backyard
Right here waitin' for you to take
Why don't we stop this nonsense
Get your feet back on the ground
For a country boy you got your nerve
You been livin' large all over this town
Heaven's where you find it
Don't you know it's true
Heaven's where you find it
Standin' right there, right in front of you
I know you men are prowlers
Can't leave nothin' alone
You always think the grass is greener
I got more than you need, right here at home
Just behind the pearly gates
With permission, I'll demonstrate
Here's a clue, for what it's worth
There's a paradise right here on Earth
Heaven's where you find it
Don't you know it's true
Heaven's where you find it
Standin' right there, right in front of you
