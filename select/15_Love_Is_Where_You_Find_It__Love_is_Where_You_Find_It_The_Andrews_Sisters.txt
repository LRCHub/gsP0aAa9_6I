Oh, love is where you find it
No matter where you go
You may be in Kailua or Kokomo
You may be on the ocean
Or by a wishing well
The streetlights may be blinking when
You get that sinking spell

Cupid gets around back and forth
Now it's North Carolina, then it's China
Doesn't seem to matter at all
You can fall on a hayride or a slayride

So, wear a suit of armor
When you go out to play
'Cause love, love, love, is where you'll find it
And you'll find it out someday

Oh, love is where you'll find it
And you find it everywhere
It happens in Tahiti and Old Times Square
You may be at a college quiz
And there the answer is
You look at her and sigh
She looks into your eyes
Ba-da-da love is where you'll find it

Da-da-da-da-da

Oh, love could happen when you go out to play
Oh, love you'll find it out someday
And then your life will be so sweet
And the world will be complete
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

So wear a suit of armor
When you go out to play, play, play
Oh, love,(Oh love)
Oh, love, (Oh love)
Oh, love is where you'll find it
Ba-da-da-da
