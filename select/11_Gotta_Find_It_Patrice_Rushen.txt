Is it your loving touch
Ooh, that meant so much
Is it your smiling face
I can't replace
Gotta find it

What is it that I miss
I can't fight it
Is it your tender kiss
I can't resist it
Gotta find it

Since you've been gone from me
My life seems so lonely
And incomplete without you

Thinkin' 'bout love so sweet
I can feel the warmth your love
Used to bring to me

Is it your loving touch
Ooh, that meant so much
Is it your smiling face
I can't replace
Gotta find it

What is it that I miss
I can't fight it
Is it your tender kiss
I can't resist it
Gotta find it

I tried to play the role of the loner
Under control without you
But there's no substitute for the real
And baby you know it's you

Is it your loving touch
Ooh, that meant so much
Is it your smiling face
I can't replace
Gotta find it

Gotta find the love that was mine
What I look for is the love I adore

Repeat the last verse and fade.
