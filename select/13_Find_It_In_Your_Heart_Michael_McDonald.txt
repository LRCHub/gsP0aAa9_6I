Ooh, no no, yah yah,
When desire moves from head to heart
You may lose a luxury
To have your fun and play it smart
Take your pleasure and still be free
Oh, the loneliness at the end of every dream
Don't you know that there's no to be
Let go of all your reasons and
Find something to believe

You gotta find it in your heart
You know to find it in your heart now baby
Our love's the truth that sets us free
You only find it in your heart

Now that you've found someone who cares
Got your life all figured out
But the truth is you're not really there
To you give in beyond a doubt
Let go, let go baby
Of your fantasies ooh
And start looking for something real
You best thinking is what got you here
Illusion will be shattered by the truth that is revealed

You better find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart
Oh, love's the thing that sets us free
Oh girl, get out of your head

Let go, let go baby
Of your fantasies ooh
And start looking for something real
You best thinking is what got you here
Illusion will be shattered by the truth that is revealed

You better find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart
Oh, love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head

You may think it's a matter of choice
But there's only one answer,
Only one voice

You better find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart
Oh, love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head

Find it in your heart
You better find it in your heart
Oh, love's the truth that sets us free
Oh girl, get out of your head

Find it
You better find it in your heart
Find It
You better find it in your heart
Find It
You better find it in your heart
Find it
You better find it in your heart
Find It
You better find it in your heart
Find It
You better find it in your heart
Find It
You better find it in your heart
Your love will never be the same,
But girl you gotta get out of your heart
