Love is where you find it
Don't be blind it's
All around you everywhere
Take it, take a chance now
For romance now
Tell the someone that you care
Spring love comes upon you
When its gone you feel despair
Soon though in the moon glow
You'll find that a new love is there

Love is where you find it
Fate designed it
To be waiting everywhere
It may hide from you for a while
It may come tonight in a smile
Love is where you find it
Fate designed it
To be waiting everywhere
Take it, take a chance now
For romance
Tell the someone that you care
