Never thought the night bring
A thrill I never knew.
But love is where you find it
And I found it here with you.

I never dream my heart would sing
Before the day was through.
But, love is where you find it
And I found it here with you.

Country lane, city street
It doesn't matter where
Never knew when you will meet your love waiting there.

I never thought the dreams I dreamed could possibly come true,
But, love is where you find it
And I found it
Here with you.

I wondered near and far
I wished upon star.
And darling here you are
At last.

My guardian angel must have sent you to find me.
Now, I've left the heartaches behind me.

Although, the road was long,
My heart and I were strong
And now the saddest song
Is past.

In this big world full of losers
The beggars can't be choosers.
I wished on my star
And here you are at last.

In this big world full of losers
Though beggars can't be choosers

I wished on my star
And here you are
At last.
